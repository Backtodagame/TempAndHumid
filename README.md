# TempAndHumid
This is a Arduino project that uses DHT11 sensor to measure temperature and humidity. All the results are shown LCD 1602.I use 2 led such as green and red one to show the 2 different state about humidity.
At the beginning, 2 led is off. When running the program, if the humidity is lower than 80, the Green led is light while the red one is OFF. Therefore the red ones will light and the green will also OFF when the humidity is above 80.
